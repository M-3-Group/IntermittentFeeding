# IntermittentFeeding
Codes for the paper "Optimizing microbial intake helps to maintain the gut microbiome diversity" by Vitor M. Marquioni, Ann-Cathrin Hofacker, Jocksan V. Villavicencio, and Florence Bansept

## File 1: Intermittent Feeding - 2 types.nb
This code integrates the dynamics for a two microbial types case. It also calculates the heatmap the time-averaged Shannon diversity, identifying the Optimal Feeding Strategy and calculating its linear approximation. (It is the code behind figures 1 and 2)

## File 2: Maximal Diversity - Many types.nb
This code uses the numerical method we describe in the paper to solve the equation of the optimal feeding rate in the where there are many different microbial types with random parameters. (It is the code behind figures 3, 4 and supplementary ones.)
